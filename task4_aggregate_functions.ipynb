    "## Interview Questions and Answers\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **What is GROUP BY?**  \n",
    "   `GROUP BY` is used to group rows sharing a property (e.g., department) so aggregate functions can be applied to each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Difference between WHERE and HAVING?**  \n",
    "   - `WHERE` filters rows before grouping.  \n",
    "   - `HAVING` filters groups after aggregation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **How does COUNT(*) differ from COUNT(column)?**  \n",
    "   - `COUNT(*)` counts all rows.  \n",
    "   - `COUNT(column)` counts only rows where `column` is not NULL.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Can you group by multiple columns?**  \n",
    "   Yes, you can group by multiple columns by listing them in the `GROUP BY` clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **What is ROUND() used for?**  \n",
    "   `ROUND()` rounds numeric values to a specified number of decimal places.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **How do you find the highest salary by department?**  \n",
    "   Using `GROUP BY department` and `MAX(salary)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **What is the default behavior of GROUP BY?**  \n",
    "   It aggregates rows into groups based on unique values of the columns specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Explain AVG and SUM.**  \n",
    "   - `AVG()` computes the average of values in a group.\n",
    "- `SUM()` computes the total.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **How to count distinct values?**  \n",
    "   Use `COUNT(DISTINCT column)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **What is an aggregate function?**  \n",
    "    A function that operates on a set of rows and returns a single summary value.\n"
